# 🌐 My Developer Portfolio

Hey — I'm a **full-stack web developer** with a passion for building things that look clean, function smoothly, and tell a story. This portfolio is where I keep everything I’m working on, from creative frontend builds to AI and robotics experiments.

This repo houses the **codebase for my portfolio website**, built to showcase my projects, ongoing work, and the way I think as a developer, maker, and problem-solver.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 I build with **React**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **CSS**, keeping my UI crisp and my backend clean.
- ⚙️ I’m expanding into **robotics, drones, and computer vision** using tools like **Python**, **OpenCV**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Arduino**.
- 🧠 Constantly learning — currently diving deeper into **AI/ML**, **embedded systems**, and **hardware integrations**.
- 🛠️ I like working on projects that blend **software and hardware**, from AI-enhanced web apps to real-world robotics.

## 🔭 What I’m Learning Now

- ✅ Training ML models with TensorFlow + deploying with TensorFlow.js
- ✅ Computer vision with Python (object detection, tracking, etc.)
- ✅ Raspberry Pi + Arduino-based robotics (movement, sensors, automation)
- ✅ Web + hardware integrations (controlling devices from browser)
- ✅ Blender modeling for real-time 3D rendering in React

## 🎯 My Goal

To blend **software engineering** with **physical computing** in a way that makes projects come alive — whether it's a virtual passport you can customize or a robot that reacts to the world.

This portfolio is evolving with me. If you're checking this out, welcome — and feel free to connect if you're building wild stuff too.

## 🤝 Let's Build

Got a collab in mind? Want to jam on a side project? DM me or drop an issue. This repo is just the beginning — my goal is to create things that make people pause and say, *“wait, you built that?”*
